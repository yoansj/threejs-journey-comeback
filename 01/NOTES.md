# 01 - Introduction

Like most I first heard of Bruno Simon through his portfolio https://bruno-simon.com/ which was really mind-boggling
While reading this course again I even found more of the cool stuff he did:
- https://awwwards-2022-workshop.vercel.app/
- https://infinite-world.vercel.app/
- https://experiment-woodkid-volcano-robot.vercel.app/

The what will you learn section was updated wwith the r3f section which I already knew about but still very cool
this course is definetely woth it's prize, it was already woth at the beginning and it's even better now

Don’t worry, I’m keeping Three.js Journey up to date. I’ve actually been doing that for a while. As I’m writing this lesson, Three.js Journey has been out for 2 years and during those 2 years, I kept updating the dependencies and the lessons. I’ve added 37 hours of video. Yes, that’s more than half of the current duration of the course. And I’ll keep adding content that students of Three.js Journey, will get access to without paying any extra.

*This is a huge flex oh my god*

Find the moment of the day where you learn best. For me, it’s in the morning. Do not try to rush things and complete the whole course in only one week. The brain needs time to process items, and it does it best at night. Maybe try one or two (three tops) lessons a day. Eat well, sleep enough, drink, and stay healthy. And don't forget to shut down any distractions.
```

I currently work a full time job that is already programming so I will probably try to do lessons in the weekend instead of playing games and sticking to gaming during the week after work.

You don't need to be good at maths. I'm terrible at it, and still, I manage to create cool WebGL experiences. Yes, being good at it would be a plus, but you can do without it, and I'll explain the formulas.
