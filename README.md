# Revisiting Three.js journey after a few years

New lessons have been added so I will check them out while redoing all of the course
Taking notes for each lesson even though I will probably read the text instead of watching the videos
I prefer learning with text, makes it easier to go out of your way and do things differently whereas when watching
a video I tend to do exactly how it's done in it. Try a lot of customisation for all the lessons, try to do a mini project everytime
Maybe trying to use the vue wrapper of three js too ?
Will probably host all of the exercises on a website at some point
Every lesson has it's own folder, every folder will have a NOTES.md file with my notes for the lesson
